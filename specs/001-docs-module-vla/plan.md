# Implementation Plan: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) Module

**Branch**: `001-docs-module-vla` | **Date**: 2025-12-16 | **Spec**: [specs/001-docs-module-vla/spec.md](specs/001-docs-module-vla/spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-docs-module-vla/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/sp.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

The primary objective is to create Module 4, titled 'Vision-Language-Action (VLA)', for the textbook. This module will consist of four detailed chapters, structured as Docusaurus markdown files within `my-book/docs/module-04-vla/`, covering the introduction to VLA, voice-to-action systems, cognitive planning with LLMs, and a capstone autonomous humanoid example. The technical approach involves generating clear, structured markdown content with headings, bullet points, conceptual diagrams, and short examples suitable for a learning environment.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Markdown  
**Primary Dependencies**: Docusaurus (for documentation structure and rendering)  
**Storage**: Filesystem (markdown files within the `my-book/docs/module-04-vla` directory)  
**Testing**: Docusaurus build process validation, content review for accuracy and readability  
**Target Platform**: Web (static site generated by Docusaurus)  
**Project Type**: Docs (Textbook module as part of a static Docusaurus site)  
**Performance Goals**:
- Fast build times for the Docusaurus site.
- Responsive and easily navigable web pages for learners.
**Constraints**:
- Content must be suitable for an educational textbook, maintaining accuracy and pedagogical clarity.
- Adherence to Docusaurus markdown best practices for optimal rendering and user experience.
- All content generation will adhere to the principles outlined in the project's constitution.
**Scale/Scope**: Four chapters for Module 4, covering specific VLA topics. The module is expected to comprise approximately 20-30 pages of detailed educational content.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **I. Structured, Accurate, and Spec-Driven Writing**: This plan adheres to the principle by focusing on generating structured markdown content directly from the feature specification, ensuring accuracy and alignment with the module's learning objectives. (PASS)
- **II. Clarity, Coherence, and Consistency**: The plan prioritizes clear, coherent, and consistent language within the module's chapters, targeting a technical audience. (PASS)
- **III. Hands-On Learning Focus**: While primarily theoretical, the content will include short examples and conceptual diagrams to support hands-on understanding. (PASS)
- **Technology Stack (Constraint)**: The plan utilizes Docusaurus for documentation, which is aligned with the project's constitution. (PASS)
- **Deployment Target (Constraint)**: The output will be Docusaurus markdown, intended for deployment on GitHub Pages. (PASS)
- **Scope (Constraint)**: The module's content is focused on Vision-Language-Action within robotics, aligning with the textbook's educational scope. (PASS)

## Project Structure

### Documentation (this feature)

```text
specs/001-docs-module-vla/
├── plan.md              # This file (/sp.plan command output)
├── research.md          # Phase 0 output (/sp.plan command)
├── data-model.md        # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command)
├── quickstart.md        # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command)
├── contracts/           # Phase 1 output (/sp.plan command)
└── tasks.md             # Phase 2 output (/sp.tasks command - NOT created by /sp.plan)
```

### Source Code (repository root)

The generated content will reside within the existing Docusaurus documentation structure:

```text
my-book/docs/
└── module-04-vla/
    ├── index.md
    ├── lesson-01-voice-to-action.md
    ├── lesson-02-cognitive-planning.md
    └── lesson-03-autonomous-humanoid.md
```

**Structure Decision**: The content will be integrated into the `my-book/docs` directory, following the specified `module-04-vla` subdirectory structure, consistent with Docusaurus documentation practices. This aligns with the existing project conventions.
