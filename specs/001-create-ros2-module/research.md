# Research: Create ROS 2 Docusaurus Module

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-ros2-module`  
**Created**: 2025-12-16  

## Summary

No specific research is required for this task. The content creation and Docusaurus structuring are well-defined in the feature specification and the user prompt. The technical concepts (ROS 2, rclpy, URDF, Docusaurus, Markdown) are established and do not require further investigation for planning purposes.
